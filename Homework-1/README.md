# Homework 1
In this assignment, an Applied Neural Network is created and trained to identify numbers out of the [MNIST Digit Set](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist).
The original model uses an architecture of 2 hidden layers with 500 neurons each. It is then trained for 30 epochs and the loss and accuracy for the validation and
training sets are reported and analyzed. This is done for three other models, analyzing all of the other model's strengths and weakness and coming to a conclusion for
the most effective model.
</br></br>This Homework assignment is created in a [Jupyter Notebbok](https://jupyter.org/) and makes use of many tools like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), 
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras), [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and 
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
